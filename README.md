# NumberBlocks

OpenSCAD design for an educational number blocks toy. This toy has been designed to assist those caring for/home schooling young children. It allows number "sentences" to be created from a series of interlocking blocks, which could be used in a variety of educational games and at levels from pre-school (kindergarten) to primary school.

This requires the roundedCube module which can be found here:

Thanks to https://github.com/Sembiance for creating it!

Just add a character or unicode string (prefix with "/u") to create a custom block.
